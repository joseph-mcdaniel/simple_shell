.SH Overview
The shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or the terminal,
interprets them, and generally executes other commands. Commands can be typed
directly to the running shell or can be put into a file and teh file can be
executed directly by the shell.
.SH Invocation
An interactive shell is one started without non-option arguments.

it looks for the variable _ENV in the environment, expands its value if it
appears there, and uses the expanded value as the name of a file to read and
execute.
